## To create a new project from scratch, with a new repository
Log in to c9 with github
1. Create a public repository in github. Don't initialize it with anything.
2. Create a new project in c9. Give it the same name as the repository. 
3. In a c9 `terminal`:

    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/khoonster/how_to_git.git
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Initial commit (this is the name of the commit)"
    git push

Change the remote URL based on what it says in your githup repository


git push -u origin master

`git init`: 
    initializes the local repository

`git remote add origin`: 
    Connect your local repository to a remote repository called 'origin'.
    This can be copied from github.

`git status`: See what the changed files are.
    
`git add -A`: Add all changed files to this commit.
